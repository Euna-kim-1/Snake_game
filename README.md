# Snake Game

"This program offers players the chance to experience the iconic Snake game in all its nostalgic glory. With intuitive controls, players maneuver a growing snake through a dynamic game environment, tasked with devouring food items while evading collisions with both walls and the snake's own ever-lengthening body. As players progress, the game's challenge escalates, presenting faster-paced action and increasingly complex mazes to navigate."
